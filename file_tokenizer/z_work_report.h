/*
    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None
        -Implemented: FTokenizer can open a file and repeatedly return tokens
            by grabbing blocks of text until the file has been read fully
        -Partly implemented: Could not figure out how to tokenize a word that
            started in one block and ended in the next. Those words were split
            in half, and produced two tokens, so my word count is too high

    Bugs: Besides issue described in party implemented, there are no bugs

    Reflections:
        This assignment was surprisingly challenging, but felt straightforward
        when I got it finished. I liked applying my string tokenizer to create
        something bigger.
