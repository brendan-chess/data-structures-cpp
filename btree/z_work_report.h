        -Implemented: All BTree functions
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs: None

    Reflections:
        This structure was without a doubt the most challenging one to
        implement so far, and I enjoyed figuring it out. I learned how
        important it is to test code early because I found bugs in my array
        util functions while I was making the BTree, which I don't want to
        have happen in the future with a project that has many more layers.
