        -Implemented: Insert and pop in the heap, as well as big 3 functions
            and other helper functions
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs: There are no bugs

    Reflections:
        Doing this project solidified my knowledge of using dynamic memory and
        ironed out some confusion I had about it before. I like heaps the most
        so far compared to the other structures we have done.
