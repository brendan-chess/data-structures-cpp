/*
    Features:
        -Not Implemented: Support of extended ASCII characters in the input
        -Implemented: Extraction of tokens for words, spaces, punctuation,
            symbols, and numbers with or without a decimal has been tested.
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs: There are no bugs

    Reflections:
        Getting the get token function to work 100% properly was challenging
        for me, but I eventually got the bugs worked out. I enjoyed designing
        the state machine, which I learned for the first time here.
