    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None
        -Implemented: Rotate functions
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs: Features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:
        I needed an extra day to complete this assignment because of issues
        I discovered when doing tests. If I had focused on understanding the
        concepts at the lowest level first, I could have written my functions
        better the first time and not have gotten stuck for a few days.
