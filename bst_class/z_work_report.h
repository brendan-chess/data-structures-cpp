    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None
        -Implemented: All tree functions and BST class methods
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs: No bugs are in the implemented features

    Reflections:
        I grasped the concepts of all the tree functions easily on paper, but
        it was challenging to understand the recursion that happened in the
        code. tree_add was harder to implement than I expected, and I should
        have started on that function earlier.
