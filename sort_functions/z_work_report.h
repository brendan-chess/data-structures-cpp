/*
    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None
        -Implemented: Bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, insertion sort, and
            heap sort. Some array helper functions
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs: There are no bugs

    Reflections:
        It took more time than I expected for these functions to really stick
        in my memory. Heap sort was very challenging to implement for some
        reason. I feel like understanding sort functions was very useful for
        my foundation of computer science knowledge.
