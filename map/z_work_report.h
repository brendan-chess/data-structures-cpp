    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None
        -Implemented: BTree remove function (with helpers), Map and MultiMap
            classes based on BTree
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs: None

    Reflections:
        The map classes are very abstracted but they still lead me to find a
        bug in my array util functions. This has shown me how important it is
        to test code early, especially if it will be a dependency.
