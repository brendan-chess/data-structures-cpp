/*
    Features:
        -Not Implemented: Couldn't get chained hash destructor to delete data
            successfully
        -Implemented: Open hash and chained hash can insert, remove, check for
            presence of a record, and return a record. Demo functions showcase
            these abilities.
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs: All implemented features are bug-free

    Reflections:
        I enjoyed doing this project, and it made me feel that I'm becoming
        pretty proficient in C++ and data structures. I wrote my list funcs
        from scratch for this project, and that was easy, unlike at the start
        of the semester.
